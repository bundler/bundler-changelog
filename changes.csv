      guarantee that Bundler does not attempt to connect to
      Rubygems and will use the gems cached in `vendor/cache`

,1.0.0.rc.2,Changes,"","","Fixes a bug where switching a source from Rubygems to git
    would always say ""the git source is not checked out"" when
    running `bundle install`

NOTE: We received several reports of ""the git source has not
been checked out. Please run bundle install"". As far as we
can tell, these problems have two possible causes:

1. `bundle install ~/.bundle` in one user, but actually running
   the application as another user. Never install gems to a
   directory scoped to a user (`~` or `$HOME`) in deployment.
2. A bug that happened when changing a gem to a git source.

To mitigate several common causes of `(1)`, please use the
new `--production` flag. This flag is simply a roll-up of
the best practices we have been encouraging people to use
for deployment.

If you want to share gems across deployments, and you use
Capistrano, symlink release_path/current/vendor/bundle to
release_path/shared/bundle. This will keep deployments
snappy while maintaining the benefits of clean, deploy-time
isolation."
